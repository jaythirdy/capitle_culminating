        <h2>I'm Jay Thirdy R. Capitle</h2>
        <p>I'm an 18-year-old student from Escuela de Sophia of Caloocan, Inc.
      <br> I'm passionate about gaming and loves to gamble. I love learning new things and losing all my ingame money.
      <br>In my free time, I enjoy playing games with solo and listening to music. Though recently I've been enjoying playing with friends.<br> I've also been addicted to a üèá game, it has only been a month but I already have 200+ hours in it.<br> The most recent achievement that I can think of is that I've been called to the OSSA to report about my tardiness („Å• ·¥ó _·¥ó)„Å•‚ô°.</p>
      <p>If I were to list the best games I've played solo or with friends it would be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ark</il>
        <li>HI3rd</li>
        <li>Umamusume</li>
        <li>Minecraft</li>
        <li>Eldenring</li>
        <li>Omori</li>

      </ul>
